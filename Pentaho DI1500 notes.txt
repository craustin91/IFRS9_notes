Pentaho DI1500

Metadata injection

The Transformation Executor step allows you to execute a Pentaho Data Integration (PDI)
transformation. By default, the specified transformation will be executed once for each input
row.


Kettle sequences are unique only when used in the same transformation. Also, they are not
stored, so the values start back at the same value every time the transformation is launched.	

	
Copying and pasting a Step into Notepad will generate the XML associated with the Step
	> easy to grab e.g. filters based on the XML tags within the XML for the Transformation



	
Summary of MDI Architectures

In general, a MDI process can:

1. To simply inject metadata and call the template transformation is referred to as: MDI
Standard.

2. Additionally, the data can be pushed (streamed) from the main to the template
transformation and conversely pulled back. The use case is when the template processes
dynamic data from the main transformation referred to as: MDI Data Flow

3. For big data use cases, the template transformation with metadata defines an _injected.ktr. -
Phase 1. In Phase 2, the _injected.ktr is used as the template for the Transformation.
Referred to as: MDI 2 Phase Processing, used in our Onboarding Blueprint for Big Data:
